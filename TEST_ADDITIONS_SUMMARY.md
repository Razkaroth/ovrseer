# Unit Test Additions Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive unit tests that have been added to thoroughly test the new features introduced in the current branch.

## Overview

The branch adds significant new functionality:
1. **Typed logs with LogType** - Logs now include type information (log, error, info, warn, debug, UserInput, UserInputSecret)
2. **Process stdin support** - Ability to send input to running processes
3. **Enhanced restart behavior** - Improved process restart logic that handles all process states
4. **TUI input mode** - Interactive input mode in the TUI for sending commands to processes

## Test Files Added/Modified

### 1. `packages/core/src/__tests__/logger.test.ts`
#### Enhanced with 217 additional lines of tests

#### New Test Suite: "Typed Logs with LogType"
Tests the new typed log functionality that was introduced with the `LogEntry` interface and `LogType` type.

**Coverage includes:**
- Adding logs with explicit type parameters (info, warn, debug, error, log)
- Default type handling when type is not specified
- Override behavior when both `isError` flag and explicit type are provided
- UserInput and UserInputSecret type logs
- Timestamp inclusion in log entries
- Immutability of returned log arrays (getTypedLogs returns a copy)
- Mixed log types in buffer
- Buffer eviction with typed logs
- Content extraction for backward compatibility with getLogs()
- Context window retrieval with typed entries
- Log order preservation across different types

**Key Test Cases:**
- 22 new test cases covering all aspects of typed logging
- Tests verify both the data structure (LogEntry with content, type, time) and behavior
- Ensures backward compatibility with existing getLogs() API
- Validates that log types survive buffer eviction and manipulation

### 2. `packages/core/src/__tests__/process-unit-stdin.test.ts`
#### New file: 177 lines

A dedicated test file for comprehensive stdin functionality testing.

#### Test Suite: "ProcessUnit - stdin functionality"

**sendStdin() Edge Cases:**
- Throwing errors when process is not started

- Handling empty string input
- Handling multiline input
- Special character handling
- Unicode character support
- Sequential secret and non-secret inputs
- Rapid sequential writes (100 operations)
- Handling undefined stdin

**spawn configuration:**
- Verification that stdin pipe is enabled (['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe'])
- Validation that stdin is writable after spawn

**Key Test Cases:**
- 13 comprehensive tests covering edge cases and error conditions
- Focus on robustness and error handling
- Validates the newline append behavior

### 3. `packages/core/src/__tests__/process-unit-restart.test.ts`
#### New file: 226 lines

**Key Test Cases:**
- 13 tests covering all state transitions and restart scenarios
- Validates the new logic that doesn't throw on non-running processes
- Tests both synchronous restart (from stopped/crashed) and async restart (from running)
- Ensures configuration and checks are preserved across restarts

**Input Character Handling:**
- Character accumulation
- Backspace handling
- Backspace on empty input

- Multiple character sequences

**Secret Mode Toggle:**
- Toggling secret mode with Ctrl+S
- Maintaining input value when toggling
- Multiple toggles

**Submitting Input:**
- Sending input to selected process
- Sending secret input correctly
- Exiting input mode after submit
- Clearing input value after submit
- Handling submit without selected process
- Handling empty input submission
- Error handling when sendStdin fails

**Input Mode with Different Process Types:**
- Sending to dependency processes
- Sending to cleanup processes
- Sending to main processes

**Input Mode State Management:**
- Resetting secret mode after submit
- Not interfering with normal key handling

**Key Test Cases:**
- 27 comprehensive tests covering all input mode functionality
- Tests keyboard event handling (i, escape, enter, Ctrl+S, backspace, char input)
- Validates state management (inputMode, inputValue, inputSecretMode)
- Tests integration with process sendStdin method
- Covers error scenarios and edge cases

## Test Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Comprehensive Edge Case Coverage
- Empty inputs
- Null/undefined values  
- Boundary conditions
- Error states
- State transitions

### 2. Error Handling Validation
- Descriptive error messages
- Proper error propagation
- Graceful degradation

### 3. State Management Testing
- State initialization
- State transitions
- State cleanup
- State persistence

### 4. Integration Testing
- Component interactions
- Event flow
- Data flow across boundaries

### 5. Async Operation Handling
- Proper promise handling
- Timeout management
- Race condition prevention
- Cleanup in afterEach hooks

## Testing Framework

All tests use **Vitest** with the following patterns:
- `describe` blocks for logical grouping
- `beforeEach` for test isolation
- `afterEach` for cleanup (preventing timer leaks)
- `vi.fn()` for spies and mocks
- `vi.spyOn()` for method observation
- Mock implementations for child_process
- EventEmitter-based mocks for process simulation

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Separate Test Files for New Features
Rather than adding hundreds of lines to existing test files, new focused test files were created:
- Easier to navigate and understand
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better organization for future maintenance

### 2. Comprehensive Mock Implementations
Mock classes (MockOvrseer, MockProcessUnit) include:
- Full interface implementation
- Tracking of method calls (e.g., sendStdinCalls array)
- Realistic event emission
- State management

### 3. Test Isolation
- Each test is independent
- Cleanup prevents test pollution
- No shared state between tests
- Timer management to prevent leaks

### 4. Descriptive Test Names
All test names follow the pattern: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
- Makes test failures self-documenting
- Easy to understand test intent
- Facilitates debugging
